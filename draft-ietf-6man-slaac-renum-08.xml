</section>
<section title="SLAAC reaction to Flash-renumbering Events" anchor="problem">

<t>In some flash-renumbering scenarios, the local router may try to deprecate the stale information by explicitly signaling the network about the renumbering event, whereas in other scenarios the renumbering event may happen inadvertently, without the router explicitly signaling the scenario to local hosts. The following subsections analyze specific considerations for each of these scenarios.</t>

<section title="Renumbering without Explicit Signaling">

<t>In the absence of explicit signalling from SLAAC routers, stale SLAAC configuration information will employed as allowed by the associated lifetimes values. For example, stale prefixes will remain preferred and valid according to the Preferred Lifetime and Valid Lifetime parameters (respectively) of the last received Prefix Information Option (PIO). <xref target="RFC4861"/> specifies the following default values for PIOs:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Preferred Lifetime (AdvPreferredLifetime): 604800 seconds (7 days)</t>
<t>Valid Lifetime (AdvValidLifetime): 2592000 seconds (30 days)</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>This means that, in the absence of explicit signaling by a SLAAC router to deprecate a prefix, it will take a host 7 days (one week) to deprecate the corresponding addresses, and 30 days (one month) to eventually remove any addresses configured for the stale prefix. Clearly, employing such long default values is unacceptable for most deployment scenarios that may experience flash-renumbering events.

<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="NOTE:"><vspace blankLines="0" />
<xref target="RFC8978"/> provides an operational recommendation for Customer Edge (CE) routers to override the standard default Preferred Lifetime (AdvPreferredLifetime) and Valid Lifetime (AdvValidLifetime) to 2700 seconds (45 minutes) and 5400 seconds (90 minutes), respectively, thus improving the state of affairs for CE router scenarios.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>Similarly, other Neighbor Discovery options employ long default lifetimes that are unacceptable for most deployment scenarios where flash-renumbering events may be experienced.  </t>

<t>Use of more appropriate timers in Router Advertisement messages can help limit the amount of time that hosts will maintain stale configuration information. Thus, <xref target="timers"/> specifies more appropriate (i.e., shorter) default lifetimes for Neighbor Discovery options. 
</t>

<section anchor="gulla">
<name>Default Address Selection Rule 5.5, Default Router Selection and Renumbering Without Explicit Signalling</name>

<t>
Rule 5.5 of the Default Source Address Selection (<xref target="RFC6724"/>) requires the host to prefer addresses in a prefix advertised by the next-hop.
It allows the multihomed host to select the source address correctly: when two routers advertize different prefixes, the host will be sending packets with source address from a given prefix to the router the prefix was received from.
</t>

<t>
In case of renumbering if both old and new prefixes are advertized by the same router (received from a router with the same link-local address), then Rule 5.5 doesn't help selecting the correct (working) source address.
However, if the prefix change also leads to the default router address change, then a host implementing Rule 5.5 could recover from the renumbering quickly, i.e.:
</t>

<ol>
<li>
<t>
The host receives a Router Advertisement (RA, <xref target="RFC4861"/>) from the router (link-local address LLA_A) with a PIO  containing pref_a, forms IPv6 addresses from that prefix using SLAAC.
</t>
</li>

<li>
<t>
An IPv6 prefix configured on the link changes from pref_a to pref_b.
The host does not receive any explicit signal about the prefix change and does not clear stale IPv6 configuration from its interface.
</t>
</li>

<li>
<t>
The host receives an RA from the router (link-local address LLA_B) with a new PIO for  pref_b and forms new addresses from that prefix.
</t>
</li>

<li>
<t>
Link-local address LLA_A is not reachable anymore, as the host changes the network attachment point.
Neighbor Unreachability Detection (<xref target="RFC4861"/>) detects that the next-hop is no longer reachable, and removes LLA_A from the list of default routers.
</t>
</li>
<li>
<t>
The host is using LLA_B as a next-hop for outgoing traffic, so addresses from the pref_b are selected, and addresses from pref_a are not used.
</t>
</li>


</ol>

<t>
It should be noted that <xref target="RFC6724"/> does not require all implementations to support Rule 5.5, limiting the support to systems which track which router advertized which prefix. However <xref target="I-D.ietf-6man-rfc6724-update"/> elevates Rule 5.5 support to MUST for all systems.
</t>

<t>
As per <xref target="RFC8028"/>, "A host SHOULD select default routers for each prefix it is assigned an address in.
Routers that have advertised the prefix in their Router Advertisement message SHOULD be preferred over routers that do not advertise the prefix."
If the host complies with <xref target="RFC8028"/>, then the proposed mechanism would work even better, and would provide fast recovery from a renumbering event:
</t>
<ul>
<li>
<t>
The host selects a default router with link-local address LLA_A for pref_a.
</t>
</li>
<li>
<t>
The prefix on the link changes from pref_a to pref_b.
</t>
</li>
<li>
<t>
When the host receives an RA from LLA_B, containing a PIO for pref_b, the host selects another default gateway, LLA_B. 
</t>
</li>
<li>
<t>
Neighbor Unreachability Detection detects that LLA_A is not reachable, and removes it from the neighbor cache table, so the host can not use it as a default gateway anymore. The host switches to using LLA_B as a default gateway and, in accordance with Rule 5.5, starts using addresses from pref_b.
</t>
</li>
</ul>


<t><xref target="ras"/> provides recommendations for routers generating prefix-specific link-local addresses, to help hosts infer when information may have become stale.</t>

</section>


<section title="Renumbering with Explicit Signaling">

<t>In scenarios where a local router is aware of the renumbering event, it may try to phase out the stale network configuration information. In these scenarios, there are two aspects to be considered:
<list style="symbols">
<t>The amount of time during which the router should continue trying to deprecate the stale network configuration information.</t>
<t>The ability of SLAAC hosts to phase out stale configuration.</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>Since the network could become partitioned at any point in time and for an arbitrarily long period of time, in order to reliably deprecate stale information, a router should try to deprecate such information for its maximum possible lifespan. 
</t>

<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="NOTE:"><vspace blankLines="0" />
For example, a router should try to deprecate a prefix (via a PIO) for a period of time equal to the "Preferred Lifetime" used when advertising the prefix, and try to invalidate the prefix for a period of time equal to the "Valid Lifetime" <!--(see Section 12 of <xref target="RFC4861"/>)-->used when advertising the prefix. 
</t>
<t>
Once the number of seconds in the original "Preferred Lifetime" have elapsed, all hosts will have deprecated the corresponding addresses, while once the number of seconds in the "Valid Lifetime" have elapsed, the corresponding addresses will have been invalidated and removed.
</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>Thus, use of more appropriate default lifetimes for Neighbor Discovery options, as specified in <xref target="timers"/>, will reduce the amount of time stale options would need to be advertised by a router to ensure that the associated information is reliably phased out.</t>


<t>In the case of PIOs, in scenarios where a router has positive knowledge that a prefix has become invalid (and thus could signal this condition to local hosts), the current specifications will prevent SLAAC hosts from fully recovering from such stale information: Item "e)" of Section 5.5.3 of <xref target="RFC4862"/> specifies that an RA may never reduce the "RemainingLifetime" to less than 2 hours. Additionally, if the "RemainingLifetime" of an address is less than 2 hours, then a "Valid Lifetime" less than 2 hours will be ignored. The inability to invalidate a stale prefix may prevent communications with the new "owners" of a prefix, and thus is highly undesirable. On the other hand, the Preferred Lifetime of an address may be reduced to any value to avoid the use of addresses from a stale prefix for new communications. 
</t>
<t><xref target="sig-stale-config"/> formally updates <xref target="RFC4862"/> to remove this restriction, such that hosts may react to the advertised "Valid Lifetime" even if it is less than 2 hours. <xref target="init"/> recommends that routers disseminate network configuration information when a network interface is initialized or reconfigured, such that configuration information propagates in a timelier manner.  <!--<xref target="graceful-close"/> recommends that when SLAAC router implementation is disabled, it advertises previously-advertised information with small lifetimes, such that the information is phased out in a graceful manner.-->

<section title="More Appropriate Neighbor Discovery Option Lifetimes" anchor="timers">

<t hangText="NOTE:"><vspace blankLines="0" />
ND_DEFAULT_PREFERRED_LIFETIME is set to AdvDefaultLifetime, on the premise that the "Preferred Lifetime" of a Neighbor Discovery option should not span past the "Router Lifetime" of the router that is advertising the option. The expression above computes of maximum among AdvDefaultLifetime and "ND_RAS_PREFERRED * MaxRtrAdvInterval", to accommodate the case where an operator might simply want to disable one local router for maintenance, while still having the router advertise SLAAC configuration information.
</t>
-->
<t>ND_RAS_PREFERRED and ND_RAS_VALID should be computed with the expression: n &gt;= ln(1 - P)/ln(Loss), where P represents the desired probability of receiving at least one RA for an RA loss rate of "Loss". This expression is further discussed in <xref target="expression"/>.
</t>
<t>ND_RAS_PREFERRED defaults to 3. We note that for e.g. for an RA loss rate of 50% (Loss=0.50), this would result in a probability hosts refreshing this timer before it expires of 0.87500. We note that if the Preferred Lifetime expires, and the host has configured addresses for other prefixes, it will start preferring those other addresses instead. On the other hand, if the host has not configured addresses for other prefixes, it may still employ addresses even if they are not "Preferred" (please see Section 5.5.4 of <xref target="RFC4862"/>). Implementations MAY override the default value of ND_RAS_PREFERRED according to the considerations in <xref target="expression"/>.
</t>
<t>ND_RAS_VALID defaults to 8. We note that for e.g. an RA loss rate of 50% (Loss=0.50), this would result in a probability of hosts refreshing this timer before it expires of 0.99609. Implementations MAY override the default value of ND_RAS_PREFERRED according to the considerations in <xref target="expression"/>.
</t>

<!--
<t>
<xref target="RFC4861"/> specifies the default value of MaxRtrAdvInterval as 600 seconds, and the default value of AdvDefaultLifetime as 3 * MaxRtrAdvInterval. Therefore, when employing default values for MaxRtrAdvInterval and AdvDefaultLifetime, the default value of ND_DEFAULT_PREFERRED_LIFETIME becomes 1800 seconds (30 minutes). We note that when implementing BCP202 <xref target="RFC7772"/>, AdvDefaultLifetime will typically be in the range of 45-90 minutes, and therefore the value of ND_DEFAULT_PREFERRED_LIFETIME will be in the range 45-90 minutes.

<section title="Signaling Stale Configuration Information" anchor="sig-stale-config-2">


<t>In some scenarios, a SLAAC router may learn that previously advertised information has become stale. For example, this may happen when e.g. the advertised information is derived from information that has been dynamically learned from an upstream router via DHCPv6-PD, but the upstream router is no longer in use or available. In such scenarios, it is paramount that SLAAC signal the SLAAC configuration information change, to aid hosts in quickly phasing out the stale network configuration information.</t>
<t>SLAAC routers MUST signal stale configuration information by following the guidelines in Section 3.5 ("Signaling Stale Configuration Information") of <xref target="RFC9096"/>.
</t>

<!--

<t>In order to detect SLAAC configuration changes across system bootstrapping events, SLAAC routers SHOULD record, on stable storage, the configuration information advertised on each interface, including the associated timer values.
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="NOTE:">In the most simple scenarios, the advertised information will correspond to the SLAAC configuration information for the router, and hence no extra information will need to be recorded on stable storage. However, in scenarios where a SLAAC router advertises information that is derived from e.g. infformation dynicamically learned from an upstream router via DHCPv6-PD, this extra information will need to be recorded on stable storage.</t>
</t>

<t>
Upon changes to the information that should be advertised by a SLAAC router, and after bootstrapping, a SLAAC router SHOULD proceed as follows:

<list style="symbols">

<t>SLAAC routers SHOULD advertise this information with unsolicited Router Advertisement messages, as described inSection 6.2.4 of <xref target="RFC4861"/>, and MAY advertise this information via unicast Router Advertisement messages when possible and applicable.</t>
</list>
</t>
-->



<t>In scenarios where flash renumbering events or configuration changes are frequent, a router may end up in a situation where multiple pieces of information may need to be simultaneously deprecated, and thus the size of Router Advertisement messages could substantially increase. In such scenarios, routers MAY limit themselves to deprecate the most recent configuration that would fit into a single Router Advertisement message without fragmentation.

<section title="Prefix-Specific Link-Local Addresses on Router Interfaces" anchor="ras">
<t>
It is highly desirable, as discussed in <xref target="gulla"/>, to ensure that renumbering or any changes to the set of prefixes advertized in PIOs detected by hosts in timely manner. Therefore routers which support multiple link-local addresses per interface SHOULD support the following functionality:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Generating (using  <xref target="RFC7217"/> algorithm) or allowing the administrator to configure a dedicated link-local address for each prefix in AdvPrefixList (<xref target="RFC4861"/>);</t>
<t>Sending a PIO for each prefix in a separate RA, using that dedicated link-local address as a source. When populating fields in each RA as per Section 6.2.3 of <xref target="RFC4861"/>, AdvPrefixList is treated as containing one specific prefix only.</t>
<t>
Removing the prefix-specific link-local address from the interface when the corresponding prefix is no longer advertized in a PIO sent from that interface.
The router SHOULD also follow recommendations from Section 6.2.8 of <xref target="RFC4861"/> to inform hosts of this change.
</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
Prefix-specific link-local addresses functionality SHOULD be configurable.
Routers supporting prefix-specific link-local addresses SHOULD enable it on an interface susceptible to flash renumbering, e.g., if AdvPrefixList contains prefixes obtained dynamically from DHCPv6-PD.
In all other cases, prefix-specific link-local addresses SHOULD be disabled by default and MAY be enabled by the administrator.
</t>

<t>
As discussed in Section 6.2.8 of <xref target="RFC4861"/>, using multiple link-local address for the same router on the same link may prevent hosts from processing ICMPv6 redirects sent by the router. Therefore, if a router has prefix-specific link-local addresses enabled on its interface, the router MUST select the correct source link-local address when sending ICMPv6 redirects on that interface. In particular, if the source address of the invoking packet belongs to a prefix advertized in a PIO on that interface, the router MUST use the link-local address specific to this prefix as a source address for the ICMPv6 redirects.

A router MAY choose not to include some or all options when sending unsolicited Router Advertisements. For example, if prefix lifetimes are much longer than AdvDefaultLifetime, including them every few advertisements may be sufficient. However, when responding to a Router Solicitation or while sending the first few initial unsolicited advertisements, a router SHOULD include all options so that all information (e.g., prefixes) is propagated quickly during system initialization.
</t>
<t>
If including all options causes the size of an advertisement to exceed the link MTU, multiple advertisements can be sent, each containing a subset of the options.

When sending Router Advertisements, a router SHOULD include all options into each RA. However if prefix-specific link-local addresses [draft-ietf-6man-slaac-renum] are enabled for the interface, the router SHOULD include one PIO into each RA, as described in [draft-ietf-6man-slaac-renum].
If including all required options would cause the size of an advertisement to exceed the link MTU, multiple advertisements can be sent, each containing a subset of the options.

<t>
Using the link-local address to uniquely identify routers on the link has the benefit that the address a router is known by should not change when a site renumbers and the renumbering event is explicitly signalled and properly propagated to all hosts.
However, in case of flash renumbering without explicit signalling the router SHOULD be able change the link-local address of an interface following renumbering events, to help hosts detect prefix changes and update their configuration accordingly.

<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="RATIONALE:">
<list style="symbols">
<t>
As discussed in <xref target="gulla"/>, sending each PIO in a dedicated RA using a prefix-specific link-local address as a source address can help hosts to detect changes in a list of prefixes advertized on a given link.
However, this approach increases number of RAs sent periodically and in response to Router Solicitations.
Managed networks, where advertized prefixes are configured statically by administrators, are less likely to experience flash renumbering without explicit signalling.
Networks which benefit most from the prefix-specific link-local addresses approach are ones using DHCPv6-PD,  where prefixes can change suddenly, after link flap or a router reboot.
Therefore this document recommends enabling prefix-specific link-local address by default only if PIO prefixes are obtained via DHCPv6-PD.
</t>
<t>
Including all options when sending RAs leads to simpler code (as opposed to dealing with special cases where specific information is intentionally omitted), and also helps hosts infer when they have received a complete set of SLAAC configuration information.
Note that while <xref target="RFC4861"/> allowed some RAs to omit some options, to the best of the authors' knowledge, all SLAAC router implementations always send all options in the smallest possible number of packets. Therefore, this section simply aligns the protocol specifications with existing implementation practice.

<t>This section summarizes the implementation status of the updates proposed in this document. In some cases, they correspond to variants of the mitigations proposed in this document (e.g., use of reduced default lifetimes for PIOs, albeit using different values than those recommended in this document). In such cases, we believe these implementations signal the intent to deal with the problems described in <xref target="RFC8978"/> while lacking any guidance on the best possible approach to do it.

<section title="dhcpcd(8)">
<t>The dhcpcd(8) daemon <xref target="dhcpcd"/>, a user-space SLAAC implementation employed by some Linux-based and BSD-derived operating systems, will set the Preferred Lifetime of addresses corresponding to a given prefix to 0 when a single RA from the router that previously advertised the prefix fails to advertise the corresponding prefix. However, it does not affect the corresponding Valid Lifetime. Therefore, it can be considered a partial implementation of this feature.</t>
</section>

</section>



<section title="Other mitigations implemented in products">
<t><xref target="FRITZ"/> is a Customer Edge Router that tries to deprecate stale prefixes by advertising stale prefixes with a Preferred Lifetime of 0, and a Valid Lifetime of 2 hours (or less). There are two things to note with respect to this implementation:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Rather than recording prefixes on stable storage (as recommended in <xref target="RFC9096"/>), this implementation checks the source address of IPv6 packets, and assumes that usage of any address that does not correspond to a prefix currently-advertised by the Customer Edge Router is the result of stale network configuration information. Hence, upon receipt of a packet that employs a source address that does not correspond to a currently-advertised prefix, this implementation will start advertising the corresponding prefix with small lifetimes, with the intent of deprecating it.</t>
<t>Possibly as a result of item "e)" (pp. 19-20) from Section 5.5.3 of <xref target="RFC4862"/> (discussed in <xref target="sig-stale-config"/> of this document), upon first occurrence of a stale prefix, this implementation will employ a decreasing Valid Lifetime, starting from 2 hours (7200 seconds), as opposed to a Valid Lifetime of 0.</t>

    <section title="Security Considerations">

         <t>The protocol update in <xref target="sig-stale-config"/> could allow an on-link
         attacker to perform a Denial of Service attack against local hosts,
         by sending a forged RA with a PIO with a Valid Lifetime of 0.
         Upon receipt of that packet, local hosts would invalidate the
         corresponding prefix, and therefore remove any addresses
         configured for that prefix, possibly terminating e.g. associated TCP
         connections. However, an attacker may
         achieve similar effects via a number other Neighbor Discovery (ND) attack
         vectors, such as directing traffic to a non-existing node until 
         ongoing TCP connections time out,
         or performing a ND-based man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and
         subsequently forging TCP RST segments to cause on-going TCP
         connections to be reset. Thus, for all practical purposes,
         this attack vector does not really represent any greater risk
         than other ND attack vectors. As noted in <xref target="sig-stale-config"/> , in scenarios where RA-based attacks
         are of concern, proper
         mitigations such as RA-Guard <xref target="RFC6105"/> <xref target="RFC7113"/> or SEND <xref target="RFC3971"/> should be
         implemented.

<section title="Selecting Neighbor Discovery Lifetimes" anchor="expression">
<t>Many default values in from the Neighbor Discovery specification assumes fairly reliable communication of Neighbor Discovery messages.

This section provides an equation that may be employed to override the default values of ND_RAS_PREFERRED and ND_RAS_VALID from <xref target="timers"/>, by computing the number of RA messages that a router should send, such that, given an RA-message loss rate of "Loss", there is a probability of "P" that at least one of such messages is received by the target hosts.</t>
